This repository contains assignments and a final project on automated credit approval within the field of data mining. Through these projects, 
I applied various data mining and machine learning techniques to predict credit approval decisions based on customer data. The work primarily focuses on 
classification models, leveraging methods like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks to achieve reliable and automated decision-making.
