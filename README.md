This project focuses on automating the credit approval process using data mining and machine learning techniques. It explores various methods to analyze customer data, identify patterns, and build a predictive model to classify applications as approved or declined. This project was primarily developed using Python and covers essential data mining steps, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

Data Exploration: Analyze and preprocess customer data to identify key features influencing credit approval.
Pattern Recognition: Use clustering and classification techniques to group customers and predict creditworthiness.
Model Deployment: Develop a robust machine learning model for automating credit approval decisions.
