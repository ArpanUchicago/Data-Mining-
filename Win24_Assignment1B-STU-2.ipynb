    "    Please use the examples as a guideline, you are not expected to have the same formatting as the example, unless it is a formatting question.\n",

    "Remember, there are many ways to code that can lead to the correct answer, do not hesitate to exercise your own style and python programming coventions."

    "Customers are the only entities that pay, hence all revolves around the customer. As a data scientist, your objective is to understand the customers who purchase goods from the \"Mall\" store. How can you get to know your customers and how could this benefit your company? \n",

    "3. Evaluate the model results and discuss the performance.\n",
    "4. Discuss other ways to evaluate the results of your model (not general comments, but specific to your results). \n",
    "5. Plot the \"Annual Income (k$)\",\"Spending Score (1-100)\" and use your clustering model predictions to color the customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Write a short summary of all your findings and your interpretation of the results. "
